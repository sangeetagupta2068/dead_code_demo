## Architecture

Dead Code Hunt is a client-side web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses a simple architecture with the following components:

- **HTML (index.html)**: Provides the structure and content of the application
- **CSS (styles.css)**: Handles all styling, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript (script.js)**: Manages interactivity, event handling, and dynamic content

## HTML Structure

The HTML is organized into several main sections:

1. **Header**: Contains the navigation menu
2. **Hero Section**: Main welcome area with call-to-action
3. **Events Section**: Displays feature cards for different types of dead code
4. **Documentation Section**: Links to project documentation
5. **Footer**: Contains site information and links

## CSS Implementation

The CSS uses:

- CSS variables for consistent theming
- Flexbox and Grid for layout
- Media queries for responsive design
- CSS animations for interactive elements
- CSS transitions for smooth effects

### Key CSS Features

- **Theme Variables**: Defined in `:root` for easy customization
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and animations
- **Card Layouts**: Grid-based card layouts for feature presentation

## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript handles:

1. **Event Listeners**: Manages user interactions
2. **Animation Effects**: Controls dynamic visual effects
3. **Content Display**: Updates content based on user actions

### Key JavaScript Components

- **DOM Content Loaded Event**: Initializes the application
- **Button Click Handlers**: Manages button interactions
- **Animation Timers**: Controls timing of visual effects
- **Dynamic Content Generation**: Creates and updates content

## Performance Considerations

- CSS animations are hardware-accelerated where possible
- JavaScript uses efficient event delegation
- Minimal DOM manipulation to improve performance

## Browser Compatibility

The application is designed to work on modern browsers including:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for improvement:
- Add actual code analysis functionality
- Implement user authentication
- Add project upload capabilities
- Create a backend API for real code analysis
